### Hi and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a 23 years old french engineer student, and I am making several IT projects at school or during my free time.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find some of my student works and some side projects too. I try not to stick too much to one programming language and stay open minded. I currently tried Rust, C++, C# with Unity, Python with machine learning, SQL databases, Web development (HTML, CSS, JS as frontend, and PHP as backend), Java, and even the Basic Casio langage (the one I started with back in high school...).

Feel free to check my work on the following repositories!
