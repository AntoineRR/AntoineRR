### Hi and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a newly graduated (Ecole Centrale de Nantes) french engineer, and I am making several computer science related projects during my free time.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find some of my student works and some side projects too. I develop software using Rust, C++, C# with Unity, Python, SQL databases, Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, React as frontend, FastAPI as backend). I like to try new things and stay open minded!

Feel free to check my work on my [portfolio website](https://antoinerr.github.io/portfolio-website/)!
